Title: Quoridor Mini
Platform: Desktop
Genre: Strategy
Objective: First player to reach the other side of the board
Rules: 
This game is a twist on the classic board game quoridor. In quoridor mini, both players start on opposite
sides of a 5x5 board. They have to try and be the first player to reach their opponents side of the board.
Each player is given 8 walls and can use these walls by placing them down anywhere on the board as long as
they are not haning over the edge of the board. Players are not allowed to pass through these walls, and must
instead go around them. On a players turn they can either move on to a square that is orthogonal to them, place one 
of their walls down, or skip their turn and charge their barge power. When moving, if a player has the other player 
right in front of them, then they may leap frog that player. When placing walls, there must still be a legal path that 
still allows the other player to reach the opposite side of the board. If it completely blocks off the player, then the
 wall cannot be placed there. Once a player has run out of walls then they cannot use this action. Instead of moving or placing a wall, 
 the player can instead skip their turn and charge their barge power. Then, next turn or any turn after that they can use the barge attack on any wall
to permanently destroy it from the game. Once the power is used it needs to be charged again. A player can only have 1 barge power
at a time. Once a player reaches the other side of the board, then that player is crowned the winner

 

Game Mechanics:
    - Players can move their piece one space orthogonally
    - Players can place down a wall in a legal spot
    - Players can charge their barge power if they don't currently have it
    - Players can use their barge power if it was previously charged
