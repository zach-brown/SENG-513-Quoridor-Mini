Objective: To be the first player to reach the other side of the board

Rules/Game Mechanics: 

In quoridor mini, you want to be the first player to reach the other side. On your turn, you may do one of 3 possible moves:


      1. Move your pawn orthognally. If there is another player in the way then you may leap over them, as long as there is no wall in between. Valid locations 
      
      2. Place down a double wall in any legal position. These walls block paths to either side of the board. A player must go around these walls or use their barge power to destroy them.
      A placement is considered illegal if the wall would hang over the edge of the board, completely block all paths for either player to reach the end, or if a wall has already been destroyed in the spot you would like to place.
      Each player is given 4 walls and may not place another one if they run out.
      
      3. Charge your barge power. This move ends your turn. On your next turn, you may click on the barge powerup and then on a wall to permanently destroy it from the game. 
      You may only charge one barge at a time. Once it is used you must recharge it on a later turn. This powerup is the hammer icon in the bottom right of the screen.


Using these moves, you can impede your opponents progress and advance your own to reach the end of the board.
